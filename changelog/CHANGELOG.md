## dbt-coves [0.19.3-a.11] - 2021-07-28
### Bug Fixes


- [#5](https://github.com/datacoves/dbt-coves/issues/5) Generate source throws exception when VARIANT contains no json.
  


### Features


- [#24](https://github.com/datacoves/dbt-coves/issues/24) When initializing a new dbt project, it's good to create every file in the current folder instead of on a new one.
  By passing the argument --current-dir, the initialization will happen in the current directory.
